You can print early layers (usually support section), faster than remaining layers. By having thicker z-axis layers.<br>
For example if you are printing in 25micron, if you specify 100 first layers as low quality. Instead of printing 100 layers in 25micron, only 50 layers in 50micron will be printed. Could make printing process faster.<br>
Process would not have any effect during burn-in layers.
